## 1) Looking around the Francis Crick institute

- We got our lanyards and visitor passes
- We used the elevator to go up the floors
- We got our laptops and had a look around the office
- We got introduced to other people

## 2) Molecular biology 101

- This helped us understand the use of DNA and RNA polymerase to make mRNA molecules during transcription
- The video showed us how quickly the process occurs as it was in real time

## 3) Using the laptops

- We tried to install Linux
- While we were waiting for it to download we went on a walk to see more of the building
- We came back and only my laptop downloaded Linux so we scrapped that idea
- Instead we installed Miniconda and it worked
