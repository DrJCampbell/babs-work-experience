Contributions from work experience students at the Crick

In Feb 2023, I hosted two Camden students at the Crick . Their goal was to implement an analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data using the Python package [Scanpy](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy) and following [this tutorial](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html).

The first two students to contribute were Moaad and Hewan. They implemented much of the analysis, performed some trouble-shooting and started the write-up.
