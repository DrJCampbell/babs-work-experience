Contributions from work experience students at the Crick

In Feb 2023, I hosted two Camden students at the Crick . Their goal was to implement an analysis of single-cell RNA-Seq data using the Python package [Scanpy](https://github.com/scverse/scanpy) and following [this tutorial](https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html). The first two students to contribute were Moaad and Hewan. They implemented much of the analysis, performed some trouble-shooting and started the write-up.

In July 2024, Rene and Tahir continued the project. Their work was performed using Windows laptops with an Ubuntu Linux distribution installed using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). They began with an analysis of the pbmc3k data set using Scanpy but then extended this to include an analysis of a fetal bone marrow blood cell data set downloaded from the EBI.
